</br>
With all this said , a challenge arises , writers who write the best comics might want recogntion for their work , who am I kidding ofcourse their will want appreciation for their work , wouldn't you and therefore , we decided to allow the readers the choice to choose which comics are worth the $ appreciation if you get what I'm saying therefore we have opted to allow it that with a stated number of 'reads' as we would put it would one provided is a writer would they be able to monitize their work , but then again there's a catch , if my content stays their for years wouldn't it eventually get to the monitization mark , its not that easy , we would rate the number of interactions in a certain amount of time.
